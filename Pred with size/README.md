## What is this?
A data science project that predicts the prices of houses in Mumbai based on sizes.

#### -- Project Status: [Ongoing]

## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is to determine if there are BHK(bathroom, hall, kitchen) houses in Mumbai that cost less than 1000 lacs.

### Methods Used
* Statistical Analysis
* Hypothesis Testing
* Data Visualization

### Technologies
* Python
* MS Excel
* Pycharm as IDE (or Jupyter)

## Project Description
This submodule of this repo is a price prediction of houses in Mumbai.
Detailed should be developed by the analyst based on his/her visualizations! ;)
